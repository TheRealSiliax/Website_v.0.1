# Primitive Operators (Cognitive Operations)

## Die 10 Grundoperationen

1. **Observe**: "Examine this data without interpretation."
2. **Define**: "Establish the boundaries of this concept."
3. **Distinguish**: "Identify differences between these items."
4. **Sequence**: "Place these steps in logical order."
5. **Compare**: "Evaluate these options based on these criteria."
6. **Infer**: "Draw conclusions from this evidence."
7. **Reflect**: "Question your assumptions about this reasoning."
8. **Ask**: "Formulate a specific question to address this gap."
9. **Synthesize**: "Integrate these separate pieces into a coherent whole."
10. **Decide**: "Commit to one option based on your analysis."

## Kombination zu komplexeren Mustern

### Problem Analysis Pattern
```
First, OBSERVE the problem without assumptions
Next, DEFINE the core challenge
Then, COMPARE potential approaches using criteria
Finally, DECIDE on the optimal approach and SYNTHESIZE a plan
```

### Evidence Triangulation
```
Multiple Source Observation
Pattern Distinction (appears in all/some sources)
Synthesis of findings
```
